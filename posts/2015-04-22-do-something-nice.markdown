Try to do something nice for a complete stranger at least once a week. I'm not sure where I came across this idea but it's a good one. If you find it hard to do things for strangers, try this on your friends or family.

This helps you to stop focussing on yourself all the time and think about someone else. It also makes you feel great. :)
