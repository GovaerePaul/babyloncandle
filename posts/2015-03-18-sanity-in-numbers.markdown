If you've been tasked with doing something stressful or potentially disastrous, ask to be part of team - even if it means working with only one additional person. Some of the reasons why you might want to do this are:

1. It shares the stress amongst the team. No one person carries the full load.
2. Pushing back on unreasonable requests is much easier when you have more voices of "reason".
3. You get second/third/fourth opinions about what needs to be done, when it needs to be done by and how it should be done.
4. Your team becomes the sanity check in insane situations.

Some scenarios where having a team is useful:

1. Unreasonable deadlines.
2. Massive architectural changes.
3. "Quick" fixes that could potentially destroy your production system.
4. "Must have" features then need to be completed ASAP.
5. Migration/deletion of production data.
