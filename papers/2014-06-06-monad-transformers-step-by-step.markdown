In this tutorial Martin describes how to use monad transformers in order to incrementally add functionality to Haskell programs. It is not a paper about implementing transformers, but about using them to write elegant, clean and powerful programs in Haskell. Starting from an evaluation function for simple expressions, he converts it to monadic style and incrementally adds error handling, environment passing, state, logging and input/output by composing monad transformers.
